#USE CASE 1

Title: Corporate manger the software (This is not clear - Corporate manager requests software project license and vulnerability information?)

Primary Actor:  Manager

Goal in Context: get the manager the software package and license information form license vulnerability information - This is not really how this works. You don't get license information from vulnerability information. 

Stakeholders: Developer , Manager

Preconditions: manager have ability to see all the information from the data store and check the code  

Main Success Scenario: the corporate manager receives  software package from license vulnerability information . (Again, not really how this works -- simply follow the dataflows that you have in your DFD when you are describing the use cases). 

Failed End Conditions: the corporate manager not receives  software package from license vulnerability information .

Trigger: see the code  -- This is about what someone has to do to get this use case to run. What is the event that sets this entire use case in motion? 

(Fix UC 1 and then I can comment more clearly on the other use cases)
