#Executive Summary


This system helps developer and manager in making decisions while developing the system, it focuses on the fusion of external source
into the system. However, external sources does not come be trusted for zero vulnerability and licensing issues. Using the various 
components of the system developer and manager can check the policies, vulnerability, and license information during the development.
These various info can be stored in various databases and can be requested by manager or developer.


This system follows a organized way to access the data following well defined procedures, which depicts the organizational structure,
control and authority like manager is the one who sets policies and allow developers to go ahead with development if they are following 
the proper policies. While developer is allowed to check, software licenses and vulnerability info on his own so that they can understand
the threats that can be there due to the vulnerabilities presented by the external source. Motivation behind the system development is to
use the free open source system that is really vast and can be used for different purposes.
